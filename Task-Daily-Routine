      <title>Why Routine Matters</title>
      <p>
        Cerberus thrives on consistency. A clear routine reduces stress, builds confidence, and helps him 
        feel secure in his environment. Structured potty breaks, meals, and exercise also make training and 
        behavior management much easier.
