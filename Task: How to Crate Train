<title>How to Crate Train</title>

<shortdesc>Help Cerberus build a positive, voluntary relationship with the crate without using force, confinement, or escalation. This task supports adopters and foster teams working with dogs who have negative crate associations or heightened sensitivity.</shortdesc>

Understand the Crate as a “Safe Zone,” Not a Containment Tool
  - Never use the crate for punishment.
  - The crate should feel like a choice, not a trap. Treat it as a den, nap pod, or “place to decompress.”
  - Place it in a low-traffic area with good visibility and natural light, not isolated or hidden.
  - Leave the door open at all times during initial exposure.

Choose the Right Crate Setup
  - Use a soft blanket or flat bed, and avoid fluffy inserts because Cerberus tends to chew when anxious.
  - Avoid crate covers unless he’s already used to low lighting or visual enclosure.
  - Keep the crate open and accessible throughout the day, especially after walks or meals.
  - Place the crate near where the family hangs out, not in a back room.

Stages to Crate Training

Stage 1: Neutral Presence
  - Toss treats around the crate and near the entrance without cueing or commenting.
  - Let Cerberus walk past, sniff, or ignore it. All responses are accepted.
  - Track if he enters on his own and do not shut the door yet.

Stage 2: Voluntary Entry & Treat Association
  - Toss a treat inside the crate a few inches at first, then gradually further in.
  - Use high-value treats only inside the crate (peanut butter, cooked chicken, frozen broth cubes).
  - Begin feeding meals at the entrance, then inside once comfort builds.
  - Pair entry with a marker word ("place" or "rest"), but keep tone calm and neutral.

Stage 3: Calm Duration (Door Still Open)
  - When Cerberus enters the crate and settles, reward calmly, then walk away for a few seconds.
  - Avoid hovering or praising loudly.
  - Use a treat-stuffed toy or frozen chew inside the crate for quiet self-soothing.

Stage 4: Close Door Briefly
  - After multiple sessions of voluntary entry and rest, close the door for a few seconds, then open it.
  - Reward after release. Stay nearby.
  - Extend duration slowly: 10 seconds → 30 seconds → 2 minutes, etc.
  - Never open the door in response to whining or barking. Wait for quiet before releasing.

When to Use a Crate:
  - Begin once Cerberus chooses the crate during the day on his own.
  - Only use for overnights or brief absences once positive association is strong.
  - For dogs with separation anxiety, consider keeping a crate in the bedroom first.

Tips:
  - Use a crate diary to track comfort levels, triggers, and changes in behavior.
  - If he avoids the crate for a full day, pause training. Go back a step.
  - Let him watch another dog or video calmly using a crate.
  - You can swap crate with playpen or open-air gated area if panic persists.
  - Use calming aids: classical music, dog-specific playlists, or worn t-shirts with foster scent.

Christina - Questions:
1. Has Cerberus ever entered a crate willingly? What helped? 
- Yes, once or twice with high value treats. He gets upset if you say "go to crate.' 
2. What signs of stress does he show near crates (panting, pacing, vocalizing)?
- Panting, whimpering, whining. It's constant :ugh face:
3. Does he do better with open wire, plastic, or soft-sided crates?
- He scratches and chews on metal. A soft-sided create would probably be better. 
4. Have you used any calming strategies (e.g., music, scent, feeding inside)?
- Yes, thunder vest with music and scent. Feeding inside is ok but he will only lay down inside for 5-10 minutes before his anxiety gets high. 
5. Where is the crate currently placed in the home? Has that made a difference?
- Primary bathroom. I'm not sure placement helps.
6. What time of day does Cerberus seem most calm or receptive to new things?
- Morning, after the first long walk of the day.
7. Do you think an open playpen alternative might work better short-term?
- Maybe? He'd just jump right over it I think.
