# Meet Cerberus: A Puppy with Big Drive!
Hi, I\'m Cerberus! I\'m an energetic and intelligent working dog breed looking for my forever home. Please read through this guide to see if we\'re a good match!   

## Overview
Cerberus is an adolescent Shepherd mix with strong instincts and a clear need for structure. He thrives in a calm, predictable environment and builds deep bonds with the people who guide him. If you enjoy working
with intelligent, responsive, and energetic dogs, then Cerberus may be an ideal fit.

## Why He Stands Out
Cerberus combines intelligence with drive. He responds quickly to training, enjoys a challenge, and reads his environment closely. He connects deeply with people who use consistent, respectful handling. His
eagerness to learn makes him a rewarding companion for someone who values daily engagement and structure.

# His Journey So Far
Cerberus started life in a rural setting with lots of open space but little structure. His early training relied more on discipline than reward, and he was later housed in a small hotel room with minimal outlets for energy or stimulation. Despite this, he stayed eager to
connect and responded quickly to kindness and routine. When his living situation changed, Cerberus was brought to North Carolina, where he adjusted well in boarding care and showed how resilient and responsive he truly is.

# What He Needs
Cerberus will thrive in a home that offers:
* Daily structure and regular exercise
* Positive reinforcement and clear expectations
* Mental stimulation through play, training, or enrichment
* Adults and children who respect boundaries
* Limited time alone; he does best with a consistent daily care plan

He prefers stable households with minimal chaos. As a working breed, Cerberus will thrive in a space with a backyard or even on a farm!

# Who He Suits
Cerberus is a great match for people who:

* Have experience with working breeds or enjoy hands-on learning
* Value training and daily engagement
* Can provide a structured, calm, and communicative home
* Want a loyal companion who thrives on guidance

He is not suited for homes with small animals such as cats or ferrets, chaotic energy, or owners seeking a low-energy pet.
