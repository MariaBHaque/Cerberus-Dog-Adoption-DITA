    <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Overview</h2>
      
      <p class="p">Cerberus is a 10-month-old German Shepherd–Boxer mix with strong instincts and a clear need
        for structure. He thrives in a calm, predictable environment and builds deep bonds with the
        people who guide him. If you enjoy working with intelligent, responsive, and energetic dogs,
        then Cerberus may be an ideal fit. </p>
    </section>
    <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Why He Stands Out</h2>
      
      <p class="p">Cerberus combines intelligence with drive. He responds quickly to direction, enjoys a
        challenge, and reads his environment closely. He connects deeply with people who use
        consistent, respectful handling. His eagerness to learn makes him a rewarding companion for
        someone who values daily engagement and structure.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">His Journey So Far</h2>
      
      <p class="p">Cerberus started life in a rural setting with lots of open space but little structure. His
        early training relied more on discipline than reward, and he was later housed in a small
        hotel room with minimal outlets for energy or stimulation. Despite this, he stayed eager to
        connect and responded quickly to kindness and routine. When his living situation changed,
        Cerberus was brought to North Carolina, where he adjusted well in boarding care and showed
        how resilient and responsive he truly is. </p>
      <p class="p">To read the full backstory and better understand his current behaviors, see: <a class="xref" href="Concept-Cerberus-History.html">Cerberus’s Rehoming History</a>. </p>
    </section>
    <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">What He Needs</h2>
      
      <p class="p">Cerberus will thrive in a home that offers:</p>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">Daily structure and regular exercise</li>
        <li class="li">Positive reinforcement and clear expectations</li>
        <li class="li">Mental stimulation through play, training, or enrichment</li>
        <li class="li">Adults or children over five who respect boundaries</li>
        <li class="li">Limited time alone; he does best with a consistent daily care plan</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="p">He prefers stable households with minimal chaos. As a working breed, Cerberus will thrive
        in a space with a backyard or even on a farm! </p>
