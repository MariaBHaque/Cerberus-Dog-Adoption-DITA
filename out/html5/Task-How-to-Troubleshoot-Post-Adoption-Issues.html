  <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Cerberus Overview</h2>
    
      <p class="p">
        Cerberus is in his toddler phase (cute and a bit anxious!), so he is still settling in and learning the basics. 
        He already knows the command 'down' and is working on the command 'sit' after a successful leash evaluation. 
        Like many young dogs, he can get excited during play and may jump up or nip, but with positive reinforcement and consistent training, he is making progress. 
        He is currently in training with a professional dog trainer.
