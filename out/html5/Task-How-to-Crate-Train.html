    This is especially important because he has a history of anxiety around crates.

          <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">Never use the crate for punishment.</li>
            <li class="li">The crate should feel like a choice, not a trap. Treat it as a den or nap pod.</li>
            <li class="li">Place it in a low-traffic area where the family spends time. The current bathroom location may feel too isolated.</li>

        <span class="ph cmd">Choose the Right Crate Setup</span>
        <div class="itemgroup info">
          <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">Use a soft-sided crate, as Cerberus scratches and chews on metal crates.</li>
            <li class="li">Use a flat blanket or bed.</li>
            <li class="li">Do not use fluffy bedding, as he may chew if anxious.</li>
            <li class="li">Do not cover the crate unless he is already used to low light or being enclosed.</li>
            <li class="li">Keep the crate accessible all day, especially after walks or meals when he is calmer.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Note:</strong> Cerberus will only stay in the crate for up to 30 minutes. Expect very short initial sessions.</p>

            <li class="li">If he avoids the crate for a full day, go back a step in training.</li>
            <li class="li">Try music, worn t-shirts with foster scent, or dog-calming playlists.</li>
            <li class="li">If crate anxiety persists, consider a gated safe zone, though Cerberus may jump over barriers.</li>
