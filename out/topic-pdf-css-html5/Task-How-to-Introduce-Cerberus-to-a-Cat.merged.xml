  <shortdesc class="- topic/shortdesc ">
    Cerberus is best suited in a cat-free home. However, Cerberus may be able to coexist with a cat through proper training and gradual and monitored introductions. 
    This guide does not guarantee that Cerberus will be able to coexist with a resident cat.

            Be patient with this stage. Cats often hide or avoid contact when they smell a new dog, and it may take time before they feel comfortable leaving their safe space.

            Cerberus may display strong reactions, such as intense staring, stiff posture, barking, and lunging. 
            He does not currently respond well to treat-based redirection during these episodes, so handlers must be ready to remove him calmly if he escalates.

            If Cerberus fixates on the cat, mark and reward any moment he shifts his focus away. 
            This helps teach him that calm disengagement is rewarded.

          <note class="- topic/note ">
            Dogs can detect cats by scent before they see them. Watch closely for early signs of tension (stiffness, deep sniffing, fixated posture) and redirect before it escalates.

      <ul class="- topic/ul "><li class="- topic/li ">Watch for small signs of relaxation or disengagement: blinking, sniffing, head turns, or looking at you.</li><li class="- topic/li ">Mark and reward any moment of calm focus or self-regulation with treats, calm praise, or gentle play.</li><li class="- topic/li ">Keep sessions short and neutral, and end them on a positive note.</li></ul>
      <note class="- topic/note ">
        If fixation escalates (barking, lunging, growling), pause the session and increase physical distance. 
        A decompression walk before the next introduction can also help.

      <p class="- topic/p ">
        The goal is to build tolerance, not force obedience. 
        Teach Cerberus that looking calmly at the cat and then disengaging leads to a reward. 
        This builds focus without increasing stress.

        This process is likely to be slow and challenging, but with consistency and safety measures, Cerberus may gradually learn to coexist with a cat. 
        Professional trainer support is highly recommended for homes with resident cats.
