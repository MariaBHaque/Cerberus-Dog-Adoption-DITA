      <title class="- topic/title ">Overview</title>
      <p class="- topic/p ">Cerberus is a 10-month-old German Shepherd–Boxer mix with strong instincts and a clear need
        for structure. He thrives in a calm, predictable environment and builds deep bonds with the
        people who guide him. If you enjoy working with intelligent, responsive, and energetic dogs,
        then Cerberus may be an ideal fit. </p>
    </section>
    <section class="- topic/section ">
      <title class="- topic/title ">Why He Stands Out</title>
      <p class="- topic/p ">Cerberus combines intelligence with drive. He responds quickly to direction, enjoys a
        challenge, and reads his environment closely. He connects deeply with people who use
        consistent, respectful handling. His eagerness to learn makes him a rewarding companion for
        someone who values daily engagement and structure.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="- topic/section ">
      <title class="- topic/title ">His Journey So Far</title>
      <p class="- topic/p ">Cerberus started life in a rural setting with lots of open space but little structure. His
        early training relied more on discipline than reward, and he was later housed in a small
        hotel room with minimal outlets for energy or stimulation. Despite this, he stayed eager to
        connect and responded quickly to kindness and routine. When his living situation changed,
        Cerberus was brought to North Carolina, where he adjusted well in boarding care and showed
        how resilient and responsive he truly is. </p>
