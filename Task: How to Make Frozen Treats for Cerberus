<title>How to Make Frozen Treats for Cerberus</title>

<shortdesc>Offer Cerberus a calming, mentally stimulating activity that also supports digestion and routine. These frozen treats are helpful during crate time, transitions, or when he’s extra energetic and needs a healthy outlet.</shortdesc>

Ingredients
  - Plain Greek yogurt (unsweetened)
  - Natural peanut butter (xylitol-free)
  - Plain pumpkin purée
  - Dry kibble (same food as his regular meals)

Optional swaps:
  - A bit of low-sodium broth (if picky)
  - Mashed banana (for sweetness)
  - Small pieces of frozen watermelon

Tools You’ll Need
  - Mixing bowl and spoon
  - Ice cube tray, silicone mold, or Kong
  - Freezer-safe container

<steps>
  1. Mix the Base
  2. Combine yogurt, peanut butter, and pumpkin in a bowl. 
  3. Aim for a thick but spoonable texture.
  4. Stir in Cerberus’s kibble or treats. This gives crunch and makes the treat more satisfying.
  5. Fill Molds or Kong.
  6. Scoop the mix into your container of choice. 
  <note>For a Kong, layer mix–kibble–mix so he stays engaged longer.</note>
  7. Place in the freezer for at least 3 hours or overnight.
</steps>

Serve Thoughtfully
  - Give him a frozen treat during crate time, when guests arrive, or after a long walk. 
  - Always supervise the first few times to make sure he chews safely.

Why It Helps Cerberus:
  - Keeps him mentally engaged when bored
  - Encourages calm chewing (which soothes anxiety)
  - Slows down eating if he’s overexcited
  - Adds hydration and digestive support from the pumpkin

Storage:
  - Freeze batches ahead and store in a sealed bag or container. 
  - Use within 2 weeks.

Tips:
  - If he loses interest, soften the mix with broth or let it thaw for a few minutes.
  - Always count frozen treats toward his daily food intake.
  - For crate training, prep one in advance and hand it over as soon as he enters calmly.

Christina - Questions:
1. What time of day does Cerberus enjoy these most?
2. Does he ever get overexcited and gulp?
3. What ingredient combo calms him the most?
4. Have you tried stuffed bones or lick mats instead?
5. Does he need supervision with these, or can he manage solo?
