    <title>Overview</title>
    <p>
      Cerberus is a 10-month-old German Shepherd–Boxer mix with strong instincts and a clear need for structure. He thrives in a calm, predictable environment and builds deep bonds with the people who guide him. If you enjoy working with dogs who are intelligent, responsive, and full of energy, Cerberus may be an ideal fit.

  <section>
    <title>Why He Stands Out</title>
    <p>
      Cerberus combines intelligence with drive. He responds quickly to direction, enjoys a challenge, and reads his environment closely. He connects deeply with people who use consistent, respectful handling. His eagerness to learn makes him a rewarding companion for someone who values daily engagement and structure.

    <title>His Journey So Far</title>
    <p>
      Cerberus started life in a rural setting with lots of open space but little structure. His early training relied more on discipline than reward, and he was later housed in a small hotel room with minimal outlets for energy or stimulation. Despite this, he stayed eager to connect and responded quickly to kindness and routine. When his living situation changed, Cerberus was brought to North Carolina, where he adjusted well in boarding care and showed how resilient and responsive he truly is.

    <title>What He Needs</title>
    <p>Cerberus will thrive in a home that offers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Daily structure and regular exercise</li>
      <li>Positive reinforcement and clear expectations</li>
      <li>Mental stimulation through play, training, or enrichment</li>
      <li>Adults or children over five who respect boundaries</li>
      <li>Limited time alone; he does best with a consistent daily care plan</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      He prefers stable households with minimal chaos. Apartment living can work if you commit to consistent activity and reduce overstimulation.

      <li>Can provide a structured, calm, and communicative home</li>
