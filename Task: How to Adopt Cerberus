<title>How to Adopt Cerberus</title>

Short Description
This guide outlines a clear, step-by-step process to adopt Cerberus. It’s designed to help you manage expectations, reduce stress, and ensure a smooth match.

1. Explore and Self-Screen
  - Read Cerberus’s Dog Match Guide to understand his energy, social preferences, and structure needs.
  - Assess your lifestyle: schedule, living space, pets, family dynamics.

2. Submit an Adoption Inquiry
  - Complete the online (linked) Adoption Inquiry form, sharing honest details about your home, experience with dogs, other pets, routines, and why Cerberus appeals to you.

3. Initial Screening
  - A volunteer or foster coordinator will follow up to clarify your responses, discuss Cerberus’s care needs (energy, training, supervision), and answer your questions.

4. Meet and Greet
  - Meet Cerberus in person or virtually, ideally with all household members present.
  - Observe how he interacts through gentle, structured encounters.

5. Home Safety Check
  - Provide photos or a video walkthrough of your space.
  - Foster agents will check for secure fencing, safe indoor zones, and no cat/small-pet conflicts.

6. Trial or Foster-to-Adopt
  - When possible, begin with a 7-14 day trial to gauge how Cerberus adapts to your home and routine.
  - Support and check-ins are included. 

7. Final Adoption
  - If the trial is successful, you'll sign the adoption agreement and pay fees that help cover his care.
  - You’ll receive Cerberus’s full medical and behavioral records, daily routine guide, training logs, and key contact info for ongoing support.
