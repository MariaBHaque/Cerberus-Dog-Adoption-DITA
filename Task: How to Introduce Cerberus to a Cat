<title>How to Introduce Cerberus to a Cat</title>

<shortdesc>Help Cerberus and a resident cat build a peaceful relationship through gradual, monitored introductions. This step-by-step guide minimizes stress and supports safe, long-term cohabitation.</shortdesc>

Steps

1. Begin with Separation & Scent Sharing (Days 1-4)
  -  Keep Cerberus and the cat in separate rooms with closed doors.
  - Swap bedding or use scented towels to exchange smells daily.
  - Place each animal’s food bowl near opposite sides of a closed door (e.g., Cerberus on one side, the cat on the other) to create positive scent associations.

2. Visual Introduction Through Barrier
  - After several days, allow visual but not physical access and use a baby or pet gate.
  - Keep Cerberus on leash and at a distance; let the cat roam freely. 
  - Reward calm behavior in both animals to create positive reinforcement.

3. Leashed, Supervised Meetings
  - When both pets stay calm, bring them into the same space under controlled conditions.
  - Keep Cerberus leashed and the cat free to exit; reward calm Cerberus behavior with treats.
  - Keep sessions brief (a few minutes) and increase duration gradually as comfort grows.

4. Allow Cerberus’s Curiosity from a Distance
  - If Cerberus fixates on the cat, mark calm gaze or attention shift, and reward immediately.
  - This helps redirect his focus and reduce overstimulation.

5. Allow Unsupervised Access Only When Truly Ready
  - Unsupervised time may begin once both the cat and Cerberus eat, rest, and behave calmly around each other.
  - Continue to provide escape routes and high spaces for the cat, and always monitor their body language.

6. Maintain Ongoing Support and Environment Management
  - Keep safety in place: separate areas or crates when unattended, multiple litter boxes/multiple water stations.
  - Continue training commands like “leave it,” reinforce calm responses, and consult a professional if needed.

Redirecting Fixation

<p>If Cerberus locks eyes, tenses, or freezes at the cat, do not scold or pull him away.</p>
  - Watch for micro-signals of disengagement: blinking, sniffing, head turns, looking at you.
  - Immediately mark and reward any moment of calm focus or emotional self-regulation.
  - Use soft treats, calm praise, gentle toy play, or other methods Cerberus finds rewarding when slightly alert but not overstimulated.
  - Avoid flooding him with prolonged exposure; instead, keep sessions short, neutral, and end on success.

If fixation escalates, pause the session. He may need:
  - More physical distance
  - Familiar handlers only
  - A decompression walk beforehand


<p>Focus on emotional signals, not commands. The goal is to build tolerance, not enforce obedience.</p>

<p>Teach Cerberus that glancing at the cat and then away = reward. This builds focus without overstimulation.</p>

Outcome
  - By following this method, you foster trust, reduce the risk of conflict, and create a safe cohabitation environment. 
  - This process matches best practices from rescue groups and animal behavior experts.

Christina - Questions:
1. How does Cerberus typically react when he first sees a cat inside the home?
- Very alert: ears back, tail up, eyes and pupils wide. Then, attack stance and deep, frequent parking. 
2. Does he respond to treats or commands to redirect focus during introductions?
- No I have pull him away from the cat
3. Which barriers or setups worked best in your foster home (gates, crates)?
- Neither
4. Have you observed any early warning signs in his body language around the cat?
- See 1 above. He can also smell her, so if I catch it in time I can prevent a scuffle. 
5. How long did you spend at each introduction stage before moving to the next?
- We didn't do introductions properly. The cat hid in a room the moment she smelled him and hasn't left since.
