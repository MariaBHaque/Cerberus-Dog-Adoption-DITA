<title>How to Troubleshoot Post-Adoption Issues</title>

<shortdesc>This guide will help adopters and foster caregivers respond calmly and effectively to the most common adjustment challenges in Cerberus’s first days or weeks, including aggression, anxiety, and food refusal. This task provides step-by-step responses to de-escalate behavior and stabilize trust without defaulting to surrender or punishment.</shortdesc>

Troubleshooting Steps:

1. Normalize the “Decompression Phase” (First 3–14 Days)
  - Expect Cerberus to be more withdrawn, overstimulated, or reactive, even if he seemed calm in a previous home or meeting.
  - Avoid overwhelming him with new people, parks, or pets. Keep the routine quiet and consistent.
  - If behavior seems “off,” slow things down, don’t add more.

2. If Aggression Occurs (Growling, Lunging, Snapping)
  - Stay still. Stay quiet. Do not reach.
  - Aggression is often fear-based or boundary-setting, not a sign the dog is “bad.”
  - Note what triggered it: sudden touch? A loud noise? Resource guarding? Proximity to another pet?
  - Don’t punish or yell. Give space. Remove the stimulus if safe to do so.
  - Use a calm, low voice and redirect Cerberus to a safe zone or crate (if previously conditioned).
  - Document the incident: date, trigger, duration, recovery time.
  - If repeated, contact the foster organization to discuss behavior patterns and escalate support.

3. If Anxiety Arises (Panting, Whining, Destructive Behavior)
  - Confirm that physical needs are met (exercise, potty, food, sleep).
  - Use a calming environment: soft lighting, low sound, avoid eye contact, or fast movement.
  - Play calming music or dog-calming YouTube tracks.
  - Offer a treat-stuffed toy, frozen lick mat, or safe chew to redirect.
  - Avoid leaving Cerberus alone for long periods in the early days. If you must, film a 5-minute clip of his behavior while away to check for escalation.
  - Use a short phrase like “All done” when leaving to create predictability.

4. If Food Refusal Occurs
  - Don’t panic. Many dogs refuse food for the first 24-72 hours in a new space.
  - Offer meals in a quiet, low-distraction area. Avoid standing over him.
  - Try hand-feeding a few bites, then place the bowl down.
  - If dry food is ignored, add a bit of warm water, canned food, or bone broth.
  - Remove uneaten food after 20 minutes. Try again later.
  - Track water intake. Hydration is more urgent than hunger.
  - If Cerberus doesn’t eat for 48+ hours and shows low energy or vomiting, contact a vet.

5. Track Behavior Patterns Over Time
  - Use a Behavior Log (see editable template in Toolkit) to record:
  - Triggers and calming methods
  - Eating, sleeping, and bathroom habits
  - Social reactions (new people, pets)
  - Daily wins, even small ones

<p>Share updates with the foster team. Patterns matter more than one-off moments.</p>

When to Escalate or Ask for Support
  - If any of the following persist beyond 7–10 days:
  - Unprovoked biting or escalating aggression
  - Extreme withdrawal or cowering
  - No eating for 3+ days
  - Inability to sleep or settle for hours at a time
  - Harmful self-soothing (chewing paws, spinning)

Christina - Questions:
1. What signs of anxiety did Cerberus show during your first few days together?
2. Were there any moments you thought a behavior was “aggressive” but later realized it was fear or confusion?
3. How long did it take for Cerberus to eat normally in your home?
4. What routines helped stabilize him: walks, music, crate, games?
5. Were there specific triggers that surprised you? (e.g., mailperson, car rides)
6. How did you adjust your own expectations during the decompression period?
7. Is there a turning point you noticed in Cerberus’s trust-building?
8. What would you want a first-time adopter to know about the “hard days”?
