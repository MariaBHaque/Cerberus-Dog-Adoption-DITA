          <ul>
            <li>Read Cerberus's <xref href="Concept-Cerberus-Match-Guide.dita">Dog Match Guide</xref> to understand his energy, social preferences, and structure needs.</li>
            <li>Assess your lifestyle: schedule, living space, pets, family dynamics.</li>
            <li>Cerberus is not a good match for first-time dog owners or homes with small dogs. Ideally, adopters should already have experience with a high-energy dog.</li>

        <cmd>Initial Screening</cmd>
        <info>
          <ul>
            <li>A volunteer or foster coordinator will follow up within 2-3 business days to clarify your responses, discuss Cerberus’s care needs (energy, training, supervision), and answer your questions.</li>
          </ul>

      </step>

      <step>
        <cmd>Meet and Greet</cmd>
        <info>
          <ul>
            <li>Meet Cerberus in person or virtually, ideally with all household members present.</li>
            <li>Household introductions should be done on-leash, starting outside with playtime and rewards, then moving inside once he is calm.</li>
          </ul>

      </step>

      <step>
        <cmd>Home Safety Check</cmd>
        <info>
          <ul>
            <li>Foster agents will check for secure fencing, safe indoor zones, and no cat/small-pet conflicts.</li>
            <li>Cerberus likes to chew on stuffed animals and items made of rubber, silicone, wood, and plastic, so be sure to remove or secure these items.</li>
          </ul>

        <info>
          <ul>
            <li>When possible, begin with a 7–14 day trial to gauge how Cerberus adapts to your home and routine.</li>
            <li>For the first 24 hours, keep Cerberus in a small room for decompression.</li>
            <li>Introduce Cerberus to family routines on the second day, then slowly introduce family members, and, finally, other pets.</li>
            <li>During the trial period, expect some behavioral issues that are currently being addressed in training.</li>
            <li>Support and check-ins are included.</li>
          </ul>
        </info>
      </step>

      <step>
        <cmd>Final Adoption</cmd>
        <info>
          <ul>
            <li>If the trial is successful, you will finalize the adoption by signing the adoption agreement and submitting the adoption fee, which helps cover Cerberus’s care and veterinary costs.</li>
            <li>You’ll receive Cerberus’s full medical and behavioral records, daily routine guide, training logs, and key contact information for ongoing support.</li>
