  1. Cerberus might be allergic to chicken or beef. He is on an elimination diet. 
  2. Training is working overall (leash reactivity, impulse control).
  3. Cerberus's future daycare should allow him to go off-leash and offer off-leash training or have employees who have leash reactivity training.
