<title>How to Prepare Your House for a Dog</title>
<shortdesc>This guide explains how to create a safe, low-stress environment for a new dog. Whether you're adopting or fostering, preparing your home beforehand helps reduce anxiety, prevent accidents, and support a smoother transition.</shortdesc>

Step 1: Choose a Setup Area
  - Designate a quiet, calm zone (e.g., a kitchen corner or utility room) where your dog can eat, rest, and retreat.
  - Keep it free of loud noise or foot traffic.
  - Provide a comfortable bed or crate and soft toys.

Step 2: Dog-Proof Your Home
  - Remove small objects (rubber bands, cords) that could be chewed or swallowed.
  - Secure trash, cleaning supplies, and medications out of reach.
  - Tape down loose cables and ensure balcony doors and stairs are safe.

Step 3: Set Up Feeding & Water Stations
  - Use durable bowls on a non-slip mat.
  - For fast eaters, use slow-feeder bowls to reduce gulping.
  - Maintain a consistent feeding schedule; transition food plans gradually.

Step 4: Establish a Potty Plan
  - Learn the “3-3-3 rule”: let the dog settle in 3 days, bond over 3 weeks, and build confidence over 3 months.
  - Take the dog out first thing in the morning and at regular intervals; every 2 hours if possible.
  - Praise immediately after they potty outside.

Step 5: Prep the Outdoor Space
  - Check fencing for gaps or weak spots.
  - Remove toxic plants and garden chemicals.
  - Pick a potty spot and clear a path to it.

Step 6: Organize Enrichment & Daily Routine
  - Provide chew-safe toys, progressive puzzle feeders, and mental stimulation.
  - Prepare a printable schedule (morning to evening) to establish a routine. This is key during the first 3 weeks.

Step 7: Prep Household Members
  - Brief everyone on house rules: no hugging, no feeding from the table, calm greetings only.
  - Agree on a consistent vocabulary for training commands.

Step 8: Gather Essentials
  - Crate/bed, bowls, leash, treats, poop bags, grooming tools, safe toys, cleaning supplies. Prepare ahead of bringing the dog home.
  - Make sure you have these before the dog arrives to reduce stress.

Outcome
A secure, well-prepared home creates a sense of stability and safety for Cerberus from day one. It builds trust and sets a positive foundation for bonding, training, and long-term success.
